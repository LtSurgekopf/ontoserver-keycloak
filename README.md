# CSIRO Ontoserver â™¥ Keycloak

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate CSIRO's
[Ontoserver](https://ontoserver.csiro.au), a FHIR-based terminology server, with
Red Hat's [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org), an OpenID Connect-compliant Identity
and Access Management server.

Ontoserver relies on
[SMART-on-FHIR Backend Services Authorization](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/authorization/index.html).
As the authorization/authentication specification for SMART-on-FHIR is derived
from the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) specification, a
"generic" authentication server that supports OAuth2 and OIDC, such as Keycloak,
can be used to authorize requests to Ontoserver.

This projects uses Docker Compose to orchestrate four services working in
tandem:

- `db`: A PostgreSQL database both for Ontoserver and Keycloak. It is not
  exposed on the public interface, but only accessible from the internal
  network.
- `ontoserver`: The Ontoserver instance that is being secured by Keycloak. It
  has security enabled and requires authentication for all API calls using
  SMART-on-FHIR.
- `keycloak`: The Keycloak authentication server and identification provider.
- `nginx`: a reverse proxy that sits in front of `ontoserver` and `keycloak`,
  which also handles TLS termination (very much recommended!)

## Getting Started

Apart from `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine, you will
need a license to use Ontoserver and need to be logged into Docker Hub with your
authorized account. Please
[talk to the Ontoserver team at CSIRO](mailto:ontoserver-support@csiro.au) if
you do not hold a license for Ontoserver.

You will also need a SSL certificate chain and key in PEM format to secure calls
to your containers. The provided nginx SSL configuration assumes a
`ssl_certificate` key containing your server certificate and all required
intermediates, along with a `ssl_certicate_key` containing your private key. It
was generated using
[Mozilla's SSL Config](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx&version=1.17.7&config=intermediate&openssl=1.1.1d&hsts=false&ocsp=false&guideline=5.6)
tool. For the provided SSL/TLS configuration, you will also need to either
generate or download pre-generated Diffie-Hellman Parameters. See the
`nginx/ssl.conf` for details.

When building the images in this `docker-compose` project, a number of
customizations are carried out. Most importantly, the Keycloak database and
associated user are created in the database.

In the keycloak container, this configuration assumes that two text files
`username.secret` and `password.secret` are present in `/opt/secrets/`. You must
create these files in the `keycloak` directory! They will be used to authorize
the Super-Admin of your Keycloak installation, so **make sure that they a) are
not trivial to guess and b) remain secret!**. They should _NEVER_ be added to
Git, in case you fork this repository, and are excluded using the `.gitignore`.
These files should only contain the username/password, and optionally a trailing
newline.

> Here is a checklist for the initial start-up:

- [ ] docker hub logged-in with an authorised account
- [ ] PKI certificate issued from trusted CA, private key placed at
      `nginx/certs/certificate.key`, public key _with the full certification
      chain_ at `nginx/certs/certificate-chain.pem`
- [ ] `nginx/certs/dhparam` [generated or downloaded](nginx/ssl.conf)
- [ ] username and password for Keycloak created,
      [noted securely](https://keepass.info/), added to
      `keycloak/username.secret` and `keycloak/password.secret`

After completing the checklist, you can start the suite of containers for the
first time:

```
docker-compose pull && \
docker-compose build && \
docker-compose up
```

This will take a while. When all containers are created and initialized, you
will be able to access these routes from your machine (substitute `localhost`
with the FQDN of your machine if required):

- Ontoserver on https://localhost/, with
  - the conformance statement on https://localhost/fhir/metadata
  - the Ontoserver [FHIR](https://localhost/fhir/),
    [management API](https://localhost/api/) and
    [syndication](https://localhost/synd/) routes
- The Keycloak landing page on https://localhost/keycloak with
  - the admin console on https://localhost/auth/admin

You will now be able to set up Keycloak to provide the authentication service
required.

## Understanding OpenID Connect

TODO

Flow explanation:
https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_oidc-auth-flows

## Keycloak Configuration

Log-in into the Keycloak Administration console (at https://localhost/auth/admin
if executing this project on a machine with graphical capabilities). The
credentials will be the ones provided in the `{username,password}.secret` files
you created above.

We will need to carry out the following steps:

1. Create a new _Realm_ in which our Ontoserver users reside
2. Add a _Client_ in the newly-created Realm
3. Set-Up _Client Scopes_ in the Realm
4. Create _Roles_ in the Realm and/or Client
5. Set-Up mappers for the Client Scopes and Roles
6. Optionally create groups
7. Create users and assign privileges, and possibly federation

### Realm

A _Realm_ serves as a namespace for users, groups, clients, client scopes and
roles. In a fresh Keycloak installation, only one realm, _Master_ exists. This
realm handles authentication to the management console. Generally, you want to
separate user administration from resource access as much as possible. Thus, you
should add users to the Master realm only if they need to perform management
tasks in Keycloak itself.

The first step is thus to create a new Realm for securing access to Ontoserver.
When logged-in, the current realm will be shown below the Keycloak logo in the
top-right. When you hover over the "Master" text, a button "Add realm" will be
shown. Click it, then enter a suitable name for the new realm, like "Ontoserver"
or your project name if you will secure further applications that interact with
Ontoserver.

You may want to configure these settings:

- in the General tab
  - [ ] the Display name that is shown to users when logging
- in the Login tab
  - [ ] whether users can self-register, use the Forgot password functionality,
        etc.
  - [ ] Whether SSL is required for requests
- in the Email tab
  - [ ] server details for an SMTP server if you want users to register/reset
        passwords etc.
- token settings, like the login time-out

### Client Creation

A _client_ in OIDC is a software that users interact with. Users can be granted
privileges within these services, but also control which data from their profile
they want to share with the application. Whenever you see a "Login with {Google,
GitHub, Facebook, Apple, etc.}" button, you are interacting with an OIDC client.

Within your realm, click on "Clients" in the left-hand pane and then "Create" in
the top-right corner of the table. For the client id, you can chose any
alphanumeric identifier. It is used in the URLs when requesting tokens. By
default, it is also presented to the user if no friendly name is defined in the
"Name" setting. For the Root URL, you will want to enter the FQDN of the system
you are setting up, like https://ontoserver.your.domain.com. Choose Open ID
Connect for the protocol!

You will NEED to configure the following settings:

- [ ] _Access Type_
  - whether a secret is required when exchanging an authorization code for an
    authentication tokens (using the standard flow). This is recommended, as it
    greatly enhances security when you are able to use the standard flow. As
    outlined above, you will be able to use this flow if your client is able to
    "keep a secret" from the user. If your authorization flow happens
    server-side (Node, Java, ASP.NET etc.) this will likely be the case.
    Otherwise, you will need to use the Implicit flow.
- [ ] _Implicit Flow enabled_
  - If you plan on authorising applications that can't keep a secret, like
    JavaScript-based client-side applications, you will need the implicit flow
    enabled.
- [ ] _Direct Access Grants enabled_
  - if you have the credentials of the user available, you can enable this
    setting to exchange this tuple for access tokens. You may want to disable
    this unless specifically needed, since it is the least secure of the three
    flows (it is hard to keep a password secret in your application!) If you
    need to authorize scripts or other server-side applications, use the
    [_Service Accounts enabled_ setting instead](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_service_accounts)
- [ ] _Root URL_
  - see above, where the service that is being secured is available, e.g.
    https://ontoserver.your.domain.com
- [ ] _Valid Redirect URIs_
  - Especially for _Public_ clients, this is extremely important to configure.
    When requesting tokens, this is the Allow-List for which URLs Keycloak will
    redirect to. They should be
    [as specific as possible](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_unspecific-redirect-uris),
    however, wildcards are allowed (only at the end, however). If your frontend
    client is at https://ontoserver.your.domain.com/onto_client, you will enter
    something like `/onto-client/oidc_redirect_uri`. You may also want to add
    callbacks for tools like [Postman, ](https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback) or
    [OIDC Debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/debug)
- [ ] _Base URL_
  - The (probably relative) URL Keycloak should use when redirecting to the
    client, `/fhir/metadata` is a good choice here.
